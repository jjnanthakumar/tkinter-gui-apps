My father was born in 1922 , in the aftermath of the First World War and
the Spanish Flu. He grew up hearing war stories from his uncles who
had served overseas, and never knowing those in his family and
community who died of influenza. He was baptised into life in the dirty
thirties and the Great Depression where he wore socks on his hands to
keep them warm in winter because he had no mitts.

At the outbreak of the Second World War, he was a young,
strapping lad of 17, eager to defend his country, to escape the labour-
intense work in the woods and to get a regular meal. In the summer of
1943, he arrived in Italy and served with the West Nova Scotia
Regiment until he was found killed in action on the battlefield at The
Gothic Line. But the stretcher bearers later found him alive when they
gathered the dead. He spent four months in hospital recovering from
the loss of a lung before he returned to his regiment where he spent the
duration of the war. He returned home to the province he loved in
February 1946, battle worn, emotionally scarred and determined to
find a better life for himself.
